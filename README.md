# 💰 Personal Finance Manager (with Visualization)

## 📖 Project Overview
This project is a **Personal Finance Manager** written in Python.  
It allows users to **track income and expenses**, generate **monthly summaries**, and visualize data using **charts**.  
The goal is to demonstrate the application of **Python for data handling and visualization** while practicing clean code design and CSV file management.  

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Provide a **simple but extensible tool** for managing personal finances.  
- Demonstrate **Python OOP concepts** by organizing the system into a class-based structure.  
- Practice **data persistence** using CSV files.  
- Use **data visualization** (Matplotlib/Plotly) to give meaningful financial insights.  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Add and store **income/expenses** with category and date.  
- Calculate and display the **current balance**.  
- Generate **category breakdowns** (pie chart for expenses).  
- Save and load transaction history in **CSV format**.  
- Simple command-line interface for interaction.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python 3.x** – Core programming language  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation  
- **Matplotlib / Plotly** – Data visualization  
- **CSV** – Lightweight database for persistence

## 📊 Example Transactions (CSV Format)
```csv
type,item,amount,category,date,due date
income,Salary,2000,Job,2025-09-01,
expense,Groceries,120,Food,2025-09-03,2025-09-04
expense,Electric Bill,60,Utilities,2025-09-04,2025-09-10

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add budget goal tracking and overspending alerts
- Export charts as image/PDF reports
- Upgrade to a GUI or web dashboard version

## 📌 Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I learned:
- How to structure a Python OOP project
- Working with CSV files for persistent data storage
- Applying data visualization for financial insights
- Writing cleaner, reusable functions for real-world applications
